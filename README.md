Dotfiles directory for arch linux, containing configuration files for zsh, vim, and i3/i3status
Requires symbolic link from ~/.vim to ~/.dotfiles/vim to recognize the autoload directory; looking into a way to change the autoload directory location so this is unneeded
Obviously, requires symlink from ~/.vimrc to ~/.dotfiles/vim/.vimrc
